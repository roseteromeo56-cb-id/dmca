Recently me an my team have been working on modules that are provided to an app community that is completely free and open source. Unfortunately an other app Under the name of StreamerApp is using the same modules but making users pay to use them. This is not only against the modules license but also not ethical.

The modules are all under the control of the Sora team: https://github.com/cranci1/Sora

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The open source modules provided in the Github repo are used inside the app to scrape informations, the only real issue is that they require user to pay at least 10$ to use the modules, thing that isn't allowed by the License the modules are registered. And even if they did allow the modules to work without the premium version, so the 10$, the app still shows ADs everywhere which, because of the modules license, is not allowed since it's still commercial use.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/50n50/sources

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

other

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The app is providing ADs and paywall to allow access to modules. Which by looking at the modules license is not allowed since its considered commercial use.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Either making the entire app open source with no ADs or removing the option to add Sora modules.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
