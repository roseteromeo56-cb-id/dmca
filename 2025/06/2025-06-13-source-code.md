[private] the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the original educational source code and instructional content developed for the [private]. These works were created as part of an academic initiative to introduce students to core programming concepts in Python. I did not authorize the public reproduction, modification, or distribution of these works by any third party, including the individuals responsible for the infringing repositories listed below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted works include three Python-based educational projects:

1. Snake Game Project  
A grid-based arcade game using Python’s turtle module. The original implementation includes:

Custom logic for directional control and snake growth

Collision detection algorithms

Randomized food generation

Score tracking and dynamic speed increase based on performance  
All of this was developed for teaching fundamental control flow, loops, and event-driven programming.

2. Hangman Game Project  
A text-based interactive Hangman game featuring:

A curated word list written by [private]

Clear modular function structure

Input validation and display logic

Visual ASCII gallows rendering  
The design emphasized reusable functions and the principles of user feedback and input handling.

3. Message Decode Program  
A beginner-friendly encryption and decryption script featuring:

Character-index manipulation

Caesar-style shift encoding

Loop structures and conditional logic  
This project was written to introduce students to basic cryptographic concepts.

These works were all written from scratch, distributed solely within the club's internal learning platform, and never released under a license allowing reuse or redistribution.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original works were distributed through a private, password-protected educational platform and cloud storage shared only with enrolled members of the ISSAC Charter Programming Club. Distribution was managed manually by [private], and access was limited to current students via direct links that were not indexed publicly. These basic access controls were used to restrict unauthorized viewing, sharing, or publication.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused projects were copied from the protected internal distribution materials and reposted publicly on GitHub, thereby bypassing the original access restrictions. These public repositories eliminate the intended barriers to public access by:

Reuploading the private files to a public platform

Making the code accessible without permission

Enabling downloads, forks, and redistribution by third parties

This circumvents the controlled-access context in which the original works were shared and directly violates [private] intent and rights as the copyright holder.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
