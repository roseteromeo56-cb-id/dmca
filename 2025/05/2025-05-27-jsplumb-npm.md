1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
2. The copyrighted work which has been infringed is the JsPlumb Toolkit, a commercially licensed Javascript library for which the home page is https://jsplumbtoolkit.com  
3. The material that is infringing this copyright are these two packages hosted on the public NPM repository:

ttps://www.npmjs.com/package/jsplumbtoolkit  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsplumbtoolkit-angular

It is strictly forbidden in the terms of the license agreement for anyone to upload these packages to a publically available site.

4. The user that uploaded these packages should immediately remove them. Well in fact you - NPM/Github - should remove them, but it seems you're trying to avoid responsibility. Either you or the user that uploaded these packages should immediately remove them.  Additionally, a strict reading of the terms of our license agreement afford us the right to terminate the user's JsPlumb license, should it be shown that the user that uploaded these packages is a JsPlumb Toolkit licensee (which we  suspect they are).

5. Our contact information:  

[private]

6. The user that uploaded these packages is [private]. We think we know what this person's email address is but they have not responded to an email about the matter, and we're reluctant to accuse without proof.  Plus, of course, you could just take these packages down, right? You could just do that, fully cognizant of everything we have told you.

7. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

8. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
