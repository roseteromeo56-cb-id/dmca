The README statement, “Raven B4, but for those who can't afford it, or too paranoid to get it… based off b3, with the help of b4 src,” is marketing copy aimed at Minecraft-mod enthusiasts who recognize the Raven brand. It was drafted to signal thematic inspiration—not to assert that Raven-bS contains Raven B4’s proprietary code. No Raven B4 source files, binaries, or assets have ever been incorporated into the Raven-bS repository.

The [private] phrase, “b4 src refers to decompiled, deobfuscated, and remapped Raven B4 Update 2 code,” was informal, tongue-in-cheek jargon meant to engage technically minded users. It does not describe Raven-bS’s development process. All code now in the repository is original, written from scratch by the undersigned developer.

Any overlap in feature sets, architecture, or naming conventions stems from lawful observation of publicly available gameplay videos, screenshots, and commentary, not from copying Raven B4’s protected software.

Raven-bS contains no hardware-ID routines, loader code, obfuscation layers, or proprietary assets owned by the claimant. Its entire commit history is publicly viewable, transparently documenting independent authorship. The project was developed in good faith with a genuine belief that no intellectual-property rights were being infringed.

Even if Raven-bS shares high-level concepts with Raven B4, e.g., automated movement modules or on-screen overlays—those concepts are functional, genre-standard features unprotected by copyright. Only literal code or uniquely creative expression can be copyrighted, neither of which appears in Raven-bS.

Because the challenged phrases are non-literal, promotional references and the repository contains no Raven B4 code, the takedown was predicated on a misunderstanding rather than actual infringement. Restoration of the Raven-bS repository is therefore warranted.
