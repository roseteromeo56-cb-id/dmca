I am the [private] of the software project published at:  
https://github.com/monsmain/sms-bomber-iran

No license was applied, so all rights are reserved by default.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The infringing repository’s Bomber.py file copies significant portions of my original Go script sms.go, including:  
The exact or nearly identical API endpoints and URLs used for sending SMS messages,  
The request parameters and headers structured similarly or identically,  
The logic and sequence of sending SMS through multiple services, replicating the flow of the original script,  
The structure and naming conventions of functions responsible for managing SMS sending and responses,  
The method of interacting with service APIs, including HTTP request types and custom headers,  
The error handling and response validation mechanisms, which closely mirror those in the original work.  

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
