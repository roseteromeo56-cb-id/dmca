I, [private], am the [private] and copyright owner of the original work, a Telegram bot codebase, hosted in [private] GitHub repository at https://github.com/Mffff4/qlyukerbot. The work is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License, which requires that any redistribution retains [private] copyright notice, the license text, and a disclaimer.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original work is a Python-based Telegram bot named “QlyukerBot,” designed to automate interactions in Telegram. It supports features such as multithreading, proxy binding, auto-account registration, bonus automation, session creation via QR code, and support for Pyrogram session format. The codebase is publicly available in [private] repository at https://github.com/Mffff4/qlyukerbot and is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License, with the copyright notice:  
Copyright (c) 2025, [private].  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
The original work is available online at:

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing

Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Which license?**

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The BSD 3-Clause License under which [private] original work at https://github.com/Mffff4/qlyukerbot is distributed requires the following conditions to be met for any redistribution or use of the code:  
1 Retention of Copyright Notice: Redistributions of the source code must retain [private] copyright notice (Copyright (c) 2025, [private]), the license text, and the disclaimer.  
2 Retention in Binary Form: Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the copyright notice, license text, and disclaimer in the documentation or other materials provided with the distribution.  
3 No Unauthorized Endorsement: The name of the copyright holder ([private]) or contributors cannot be used to endorse or promote products derived from the software without specific prior written permission.  
The repository at https://github.com/Cybertat1on/Qlyuker violates these conditions in the following ways:  
• Failure to Retain Copyright Notice and License Text: The infringing repository does not include [private] copyright notice (Copyright (c) 2025, [private]), the BSD 3-Clause License text, or the required disclaimer in its source code or documentation. Instead, it falsely presents the code as the work of the user Cybertat1on under a different license (Apache License 2.0).  
• Misrepresentation of Authorship: The code in https://github.com/Cybertat1on/Qlyuker is substantially identical to [private] original codebase, with only minimal changes (e.g., modified variable names, restructured documentation, and altered default settings). By omitting [private] copyright notice and presenting the code as their own, the user violates the attribution requirements of the BSD 3-Clause License.  
• Unauthorized License Change: The infringing repository applies the Apache License 2.0 to the code, which is not permitted under the BSD 3-Clause License without [private] explicit consent, as it removes [private] copyright notice and fails to comply with the original license terms.  
These actions constitute a clear violation of the BSD 3-Clause License, as they fail to provide proper attribution, omit the required license text, and misrepresent the authorship of the work.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
The repository at https://github.com/Cybertat1on/Qlyuker can be brought into compliance with the BSD 3-Clause License by:  
1 Adding the copyright notice: Copyright (c) 2025, [private] in the source code files and/or a COPYRIGHT or LICENSE file.  
2 Including the full BSD 3-Clause License text in a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file, replacing the current Apache License 2.0.  
3 Adding a statement in the README.md: This project is based on QlyukerBot by [private] (https://github.com/Mffff4/qlyukerbot), licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License.  
4  
Alternatively, if compliance is not feasible, the repository should be deleted to resolve the infringement.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
