I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
1. Identification of the copyrighted work:  
I am the [private] and copyright holder of the proprietary software Sync.top HWID Spoofer, owned by Sync Innovations FZ-LLC — a closed-source, commercially licensed security tool. This software is not publicly available as source code and is distributed only to paying customers through our official platform at https://sync.top. All intellectual property, underlying methods, and binaries are the exclusive property of Sync Innovations FZ-LLC.  
  
2. Infringing material:  
The following repositories contain unauthorized reverse-engineered, disassembled, or derived content from our proprietary software. The content in these repositories infringes upon our protected intellectual property. This includes both the original repository and multiple forks:  
  
Original Infringing Repository:  
  
https://github.com/armvirus/sync-spoofer-reversal  
  
Forks (also infringing):  
  
https://github.com/eastemperor3/sync-spoofer-reversal  
  
https://github.com/gmh5225/valorant-sync-spoofer-reversal  
  
https://github.com/marklove5102/sync-spoofer-reversal  
  
https://github.com/zx99zxz/sync-spoofer-reversal  
  
I have reviewed each of these forks and confirm that they contain the same or substantially similar infringing content as the original repository. The entire contents of each repository infringe upon our proprietary methods, techniques, and functionality.  
  
3. Remedy requested:  
I request that GitHub remove all of the above repositories in full. These repositories constitute clear violations through unauthorized reverse engineering, reproduction, and disclosure of Sync.top's proprietary software. There is no partial remedy available — complete removal is required to cease the ongoing infringement.
