I am writing on behalf of [private] institute, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), [private], [private], specifically the team running the [private] [private] [private] [private].


We have found a list of repositories on GitHub containing copyrighted materials from our course, including lecture slides, assignment specifications, lab specifications, project specifications, etc.


Some of the documents include clear copyright statements, although we only started adding such statements explicitly in recent years and some documents are older. Either way, the materials are ours, not the repository owners. We suspect the owners of these repositories are former students of our course, who ignored our copyrights.


We kindly but urgently request that you take these materials down. We hope this matter can be resolved via this simple request rather than via a formal legal process.
