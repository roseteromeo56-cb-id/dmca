Concerning the infringing material identified above:

This letter is an official notification under the principles of the Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

These illegal streams are infringing exclusive broadcasting rights granted by GROUPE CANAL+ and copyright owned by GROUPE CANAL+ and constitute therefore an infringement on our rights and offense under, among others, The Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 102(a)) and Digital Millennium Copyright Act provisions.

For information, article L216-1 of the French Intellectual Property Code provides that an authorization is necessary to reproduce any programs distributed by an audiovisual communication company. However, no authorization from GROUPE CANAL+ has been given to the website manager or publisher to reproduce the event. Moreover, these illegal streams constitute also an infringement on our rights and offense under, among others, articles R333-1 and R333-2 of the French Sport Code and article L335-4 of the French Intellectual Property Code.

The aforementioned sporting event/match, for which GROUPE CANAL+ has been granted an exclusive right of exploitation, is being live broadcasted by GROUPE CANAL+, given this particular context we hereby request that you immediately remove the illicit content or disable access or block access to the above listed IP address.

You will agree, Madam, Sir, that such a sport event, live-broadcasted for a specified period, loses its interest once finished (the score being fixed and known to all). Therefore, we hereby give you notice to terminate immediately this unlawful broadcast within upon receipt of this notification.

A delayed take down - and not immediate - would no longer be of interest (the offense has been consummated).
