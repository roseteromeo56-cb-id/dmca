Dear GitHub Team,

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I am part of the Cobalt Strike [private] team at Fortra, LLC (“Fortra”).

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), I write to provide notice that GitHub (“Company”) contains certain infringing materials and to request the removal of such infringing materials.

Specifically, Company contains and makes available to your users complete copies of Fortra’ Cobalt Strike and Core Security penetration testing software products, either in their original form as delivered by Fortra to our customers or derivatives thereof (the “Products”) without authorization in violation of United States copyright laws.

 

Our product, Cobalt Strike, can be found here:

https://www.cobaltstrike.com 

 

Infringing copies of Cobalt Strike can be found at the following URL:

https://github.com/TryGOTry/CobaltStrike_Cat_4.5/releases/tag/2.0

 

At all relevant times, Fortra has been and is the exclusive copyright owner of the Products located at the above URL.

I have a good faith belief that the campaign referenced above is infringing Fortra’ exclusive rights as the copyright holder of the Products.

Furthermore, I have a good faith belief that the use of the Products is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or applicable law.

I hereby request that you remove or disable access to the infringing material identified above in as expedient a fashion as possible.

This communication does not constitute a waiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized activities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are expressly retained.

If you fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the infringing material, Company will be acting in blatant and willful violation of Fortra copyright interests and thus, not within the safe harbor under Section 512 of the DMCA.

If I do not receive a written confirmation from GitHub that it has complied with this request, Fortra is prepared to pursue appropriate legal remedies.

 

Sincerely,



[private]
