**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and  [private] of the original content published on the website capsules.moyra.co, including its design, layout, source code, text, images, and other creative elements. This content was developed by  [private] and  [private] and is protected under applicable copyright laws. No permission has been granted for its reproduction, redistribution, or publication on GitHub or any third-party platform.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work is my company’s website, published at capsules.moyra.co. This includes:  
• Website design and layout: The overall visual structure, navigation, styling, and arrangement of content elements.  
• Textual content: Original written material including headings, descriptions, product/service information, calls to action, and other on-page text.  
• Custom graphics and images: Icons, photos, background visuals, and branding elements created or commissioned specifically for this site.  
• Source code: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other code written to implement the design and functionality of the website.  
• Interactive components and structure: Any UI/UX elements unique to the site’s operation, including animations, buttons, forms, and interactions.  
  
All of the above content was developed in-house by  [private] for which we hold full copyright. It was never released under an open-source or public license, and no part of it has been authorized for redistribution, reuse, or publication on GitHub or other third-party platforms.  
  
The GitHub repository in question reproduces this content — in some cases identically — without any modification or permission.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/matthewkyleherren/caps-dev  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Our website is publicly accessible for the purpose of legitimate user interaction, but we have implemented standard technological measures to discourage unauthorized copying and scraping. These include:  
• Obfuscated and minified frontend code to make reuse of source code more difficult.  
• Hotlinking protection and controlled asset access through server configurations to prevent direct reuse of images and other media assets.  
• Robots.txt restrictions to prevent automated crawlers from indexing or scraping certain parts of the website.  
• Copyright notices in the site footer and within the source code to inform visitors that all content is protected.  
  
While no technical system can fully prevent bad actors from copying content, these measures serve as reasonable barriers and demonstrate our intent to control access and protect our intellectual property rights. The unauthorized GitHub repository bypassed these protections by downloading and publishing the website content without permission.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures by directly copying and reproducing the website’s content and source code, including minified HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media assets. This was likely done using automated scraping tools or manual downloading methods, bypassing restrictions set in our robots.txt file and ignoring our Terms of Service.  
  
Specifically:  
• The source code appears to have been downloaded in bulk, despite minification and obfuscation.  
• Static assets (e.g., images, icons) hosted on our protected servers were re-uploaded or hotlinked, ignoring our hotlink prevention rules.  
• Our copyright notice and attribution were removed or replaced.  
• The project replicates the structure, layout, and interactive components of our website in a way that facilitates redistribution without consent.  
  
These actions effectively neutralized the protections we put in place to prevent unauthorized copying and demonstrate a clear intent to bypass control mechanisms in order to distribute copyrighted material.
