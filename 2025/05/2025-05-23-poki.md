Specific files within the Repository are infringing: 

https://retro-bowlgames.github.io/

Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?

Yes

What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?

Our HTML5 games are only allowed to run on whitelisted domains. On our backends we take care of domain-whitelisting and other integrity checks. Due to the nature of HTML5 games i.e. client-side code, it’s easy to rehost and run it elsewhere. Experiments with code-mangling, site-locking and obfuscation have thus far only hurt legitimate players, whilst for game-rippers it remained trivial to circumvent.


How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?

This is a clone of our HTML5 code. Downloaded and rehosted on GitHub.

Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately. As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork below:

We haven't found any forks


Is the work licensed under an open source license?

No

What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?

Reported content must be removed

Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.

No


I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

Yes

I have taken fair use into consideration.

Yes

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Yes

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.

Yes
