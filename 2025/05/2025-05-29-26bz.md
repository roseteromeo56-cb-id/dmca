**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf? If you are submitting this notice on behalf of a company, please be sure to use an email address on the company's domain. If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the source code in question. The code was developed by [private] and is distributed as a paid product. I have not authorized its public distribution or reproduction on GitHub or any other platform.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a proprietary software project developed and owned by [private], distributed solely as a paid product through BuiltByBit.com and SourceXchange.net, and additionally branded under [private] official website at [private], which is also referenced in the package.json of the software.

This project includes original source code, templates, and logic created by [private]. It is not open source, and all rights to use and distribute the code are governed by strict licensing terms. Only customers who purchase the product through the authorized platforms receive usage rights, and they are explicitly prohibited from redistributing or publicly uploading the code, including on GitHub.

The infringing repository contains unauthorized copies of [private] paid codebase, including parts of the proprietary logic and files, without [private] consent or license.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://builtbybit.com/resources/gameboyz-hosting-company-template.53986/

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

https://github.com/OriconHost/webOricon/tree/main/frontend

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The source code is distributed only through authorized platforms — BuiltByBit.com and SourceXchange.net — which both require user accounts, purchase verification, and acceptance of license terms before download. These platforms control access to the files and restrict redistribution through their licensing system.

Additionally, the package.json and other internal files contain branding and links to [private], allowing identification of official copies and misuse of the product.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub repository bypasses these protections by publicly hosting and distributing the full source code, including licensed logic and template files, without purchase or authorization. This circumvents the access controls of the official sales platforms and violates the license terms. It exposes the paid code to the public, making it freely accessible in violation of the distribution restrictions [private] have put in place.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
