Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] copyright holder of the software, and [private] was selling the program and keeping it private. Someone unlawfully obtained the files, removed the authentication, and then uploaded them to GitHub without [private] permission. The reported repository is a fork of the original repository, which was already removed for DMCA. The reported all all forks of the reported repository have had no changes to the code, so they are still in the original, unchanged form as the original offending repository. I therefore request that the repository be taken down to prevent further unauthorized distribution of [private] copyrighted material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Everything in the original repository was stolen; the files were combined into a scanning program for Minecraft to scan players in worlds you join. [private] was charging for the program and keeping it private. The offending repository (and all forms) is a leaked version of the program that was redistributed without [private] permission. The code shared has no attributed licenses and was not available for third-party redistribution under any circumstances.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is only available on [private] as well as my team's [private] [private] [private].

Team Repository: https://github.com/AutoRatter/AutoRatter (Repository itself is public, but the code isn't present on the repository and only a secured release is available)

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

In the original version of the program, [private] had two forms of authentication that were removed in this leaked repository. The first form of authentication was a whitelist check for valid users that required a password to log in and access the program. The second form of authentication was a logging check for whether users logged into the program. If the user logs in from an unusual location, it will flag them and temporarily restrict access. In the linked GitHub repository, both of these forms of authentication were removed, which allowed the program to be shared without the original developer's consent.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Since the project files aren't compiled and are instead plain text JavaScript and other assorted file types, the code involving the technological protection was able to be removed before being uploaded to the offending repository. The files could then be shared without the proper authentication without the developer's permission, as it no longer checks for valid users or unusual user logins.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
