Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the Webmetic web analytics platform. [private] created and own all rights to this proprietary software. The software is not open source and was never authorized for public distribution.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Webmetic is a proprietary web analytics platform developed by [private] at Intent GmbH. It includes a dashboard for tracking website visitors, analytics for monitoring user engagement, API endpoints for data collection and reporting, and admin functionality for managing user accounts and connected websites. The application consists of frontend code built with JavaScript, and backend services written in Python, all of which appear in the infringing repository.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is available to licensed users at https://webmetic.de but requires authentication. The API endpoints referenced in the repository README confirm this is our proprietary code as they match our internal documentation exactly.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/roshanking000/webmetic

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The Webmetic platform implements multiple layers of access control to protect our copyrighted code and data:

Server-side authentication system requiring username/password credentials to access the application  
JWT (JSON Web Token) based API authorization that requires valid tokens for all API requests  
Role-based access control (RBAC) that restricts user access to specific features based on permission levels  
API rate limiting to prevent unauthorized scraping of data  
HTTPS encryption for all data transmission  
IP-based access restrictions for administrative functions  
Database encryption for sensitive customer data

These measures effectively control access by ensuring that only authenticated users with proper authorization can access the application's features and data through our official channels. The source code itself is not publicly accessible and is stored in private [private] with restricted access limited to authorized developers.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures by:

Publishing our complete proprietary source code which was obtained without authorization  
Exposing our internal API structure and authentication mechanisms  
Revealing database schemas and backend logic that were designed to remain private  
Including configuration files that contain information about our server architecture  
Making our authentication and authorization logic publicly accessible, potentially allowing for the creation of unauthorized access methods  
Providing access to our proprietary algorithms and data processing methods that were developed for exclusive use by licensed customers

By publishing this code, the repository owner has effectively bypassed all of our access control mechanisms by making available the very code that implements these protections, thereby undermining the effectiveness of our technological measures designed to protect our intellectual property.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
