Hello, I am [private], and [private] [private] Continuum Graphics LLC..

It has come to our attention that a user of your site is violating our products EULA and Copyright Law, specifically referencing our product(s): Continuum 1.3 and Continuum 2.1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, and we have included a list of links in violation. 

I have taken fair use into consideration. Our products and their code are not intended to be redistributed without explicit written permission from Continuum Graphics LLC..Which neither the original 'author', nor the re-uploader of this content have. 

They are violating our copyright by re-uploading the 'iterationT' shaderpack, a shaderpack built on many authors' stolen code, including our own. Here is the link(s) to our content on your site:  
https://github.com/tahnasss/iterationt 

And here are are just a few specific examples of code stolen from our products (we will also attach these images to the email in case of formatting or display issues):

[private]  
https://github.com/tahnasss/iterationt/blob/main/Lib/IndividualFounctions/VolumetricClouds.glsl

This entire shaderpack should be removed, not only due to the inoperability of it without our code, but how prolific the code theft from us, and other authors is. 

And here are some links to the content on our own site:
