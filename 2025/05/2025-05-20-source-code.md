Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,

This is a formal DMCA takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Below is my complete and revised request, including all details and evidence previously provided in prior communications (Ticket ID #3380981).

1. [private] Ownership and Rights  
I, [private], am the [private] and copyright holder of the original content hosted at:

üîó https://github.com/rdcj-research/rdcj-research.github.io

This repository is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, which requires attribution, a link to the license, and an indication of any changes made. Full license terms:  
üîó [private]

2. Allegedly Infringing Repository  
The following repository is infringing [private] copyright and impersonating [private] work:

üîó https://github.com/Fabricio031707/rdcj-research.github.io

3. Nature of the Infringement  
This repository is not a fork. It was manually copied from [private] original without any attribution or permission. It violates [private] license and includes:

Exact reuse of [private] content and structure, including files like CNAME, LICENSE, and index.md

A README.md derived from [private] original, referencing topics, language, and frameworks uniquely associated with [private] published work (e.g., Harmonic Epistemology, Prime Complexity, Symbolic Systems)

Unauthorized ‚ÄúReleases‚Äù under the name and branding of [private] repository, which [private] have never published. This could mislead users or distribute unsafe content

Falsification of the license: The infringing user removed [private] CC BY 4.0 license and falsely replaced it with an MIT license

This behavior not only violates copyright law, but also misrepresents authorship and poses a potential security and reputational risk.

Commit confirming license removal and impersonation:  
üîó https://github.com/Fabricio031707/rdcj-research.github.io/commit/29c800ef0f645db9468aa2f60dade6cd0c036acf.patch

4. Specific Request  
I request that the entire repository Fabricio031707/rdcj-research.github.io be removed, as it reproduces [private] copyrighted content and violates license terms.

5. Technological Measures  
I have not implemented technological access restrictions, as the work was licensed under CC BY 4.0 ‚Äî but that license has been violated by removal of attribution and misuse of the license terms.

6. License Information  
Original license: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

Violation: Attribution removed, false license (MIT) added, misleading release of content

7. Contact Details  
I am the copyright holder and submit this notice on [private] [private] behalf.

Name: [private]  
GitHub username: [private]  
Email: [private]  
Website: [private] | [private]

8. Legal Declarations  
I, [private], declare under penalty of perjury that:

I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by me, my agent, or the law.

The information in this notice is accurate.

I am the copyright owner of the material or authorized to act on behalf of the owner.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have read and understand GitHub‚Äôs DMCA Policy.
