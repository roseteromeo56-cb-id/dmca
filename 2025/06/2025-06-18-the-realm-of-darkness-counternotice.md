[Paste the exact URL(s) of the disabled repository or files as provided in the DMCA takedown notice.]

Ownership and Authorization Statement  
I am the [private] and [private] of "The Realm of Darkness" game system. The project began in Second Life, where [private] developed the initial in-world LSL scripts and game mechanics independently. After the project was established, [private] collaborator joined and assisted with further development, particularly when we moved to developing the PHP code on his server. [private] started the PHP codebase and wrote the foundational classes, and all subsequent work was built upon [private] original architecture.

All in-world objects and 3D textures referenced in the DMCA claim were either created or purchased using revenue from the game and uploaded through my Second Life account, making [private] the legal owner of these assets under Second Life’s Terms of Service.

[private] have not transferred or assigned copyright or ownership to any other party.  
Additionally, I have many witnesses who can attest to the fact that I am the [private] of "The Realm of Darkness," and they can be called upon if needed.

Statement of Good-Faith Belief  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

Consent to Jurisdiction  
I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake because the DMCA claim misrepresents the true ownership and authorship of the project. I am the [private] of "The Realm of Darkness," and [private] collaborator joined after the project was already established. The code and assets in question are fundamentally [private] work, and [private] have not transferred ownership. The takedown was based solely on his claim, without verification or fact-checking. I also have multiple witnesses who can confirm [private] [private] [private] and ownership if needed.
