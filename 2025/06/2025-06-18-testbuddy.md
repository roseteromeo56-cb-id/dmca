**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of Testbuddy Education Private Limited, the company that originally developed and owns the proprietary source code in question. The code was created by our [private] as part of our application development and was stored in our [private] [private] [private]. A former intern, who was involved briefly in this project, has made this code public without any authorization, violating our intellectual property rights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work includes the entire source codebase for the Testbuddy education app, which consists of frontend components (built with React Native), backend APIs, routing logic, and configuration files. The code is an essential part of our commercial product and is the result of proprietary development work done by our company. This code was never made public and is not licensed for reuse or redistribution.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our original code is hosted in a [private] [private] [private] ([private]), which is accessible only to authorized collaborators. Access is restricted using GitHub’s built-in authentication, access controls, and permission settings to prevent unauthorized viewing, cloning, or forking of the code. Only team members added explicitly to the repository could access or contribute to the project.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused individual, a former intern, had temporary authorized access to our [private] [private] [private]. After being removed from the project and the organization, they exported the proprietary source code without permission and uploaded it to a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/codeAbinash/testbuddy). By doing so, they intentionally bypassed the access controls we had in place to keep the code confidential, effectively circumventing our technological protection measures.
