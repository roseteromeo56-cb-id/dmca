I am the [private] [private] and [private] copyright owner of the software module titled “wm_ar_salesperson_filter” which [private] [private] [private] and [private] for commercial use on the Odoo Apps Store at https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/18.0/wm_ar_salesperson_filter. [private] [private] not released this software under an open-source license, and [private] retain all rights to its distribution and reproduction. No third party is authorized to share, publish, or redistribute the source code without [private] explicit written permission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is a proprietary Odoo ERP module titled “wm_ar_salesperson_filter”, developed and authored by [private].  
This module is an original creation written in Python and XML, specifically designed to extend Odoo functionality.

It was developed independently and made available exclusively for paid use through the official Odoo Apps Store:  
https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/18.0/wm_ar_salesperson_filter

The module includes custom backend models, business logic, user interface elements, and configuration options that are the result of original design and programming.  
[private] not published the source code publicly or under any open-source license.

The unauthorized reproduction of this module's code and structure on GitHub constitutes a direct copyright infringement,
as the content was copied and redistributed without [private] knowledge, permission, or license.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes. The Odoo Apps Store requires user authentication and purchase before allowing access to downloadable content. [private] app is distributed exclusively through this platform, which limits access to paying customers. The downloaded ZIP packages are not publicly indexable or shareable by default. Additionally, the source code includes license headers and documentation clearly stating the proprietary nature of the content and restricting redistribution.  
However, as is the case with most downloadable software, once a buyer obtains access, enforcement relies heavily on legal protection and good-faith compliance with copyright law, rather than technological DRM.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing GitHub project does not appear to circumvent sophisticated technological protection measures such as DRM or encryption, as [private] app is distributed via the Odoo Apps Store in source form to paying users. However, the project bypasses the intended commercial licensing and controlled access mechanisms by redistributing the copyrighted content—without permission—on a public platform.

This redistribution effectively defeats the access controls implemented by the Odoo Apps Store (user authentication, license purchase, and legal terms of use), which are designed to restrict availability to authorized users only.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
