**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I hereby declare that I am the [private] and rightful owner of the code in the java-archetype-gradle repository; the “Hello World” Java project was generated entirely by me via [private], without ever incorporating any code or assets subject to third-party copyright. Therefore, I hold all intellectual property rights to this content and am fully authorized to request its restoration.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/FCondeNR/java-archetype-gradle

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe this notice has been filed unjustly and in bad faith. The java-archetype-gradle repository contains only a Gradle archetype for a Java “Hello World” program, never including any proprietary, confidential, or exclusively copyrighted code. Therefore, the claim clearly amounts to an attempt to censor a trivial project rather than a legitimate exercise of copyright protection.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
