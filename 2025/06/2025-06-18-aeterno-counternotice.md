To GitHub DMCA Agent,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

My name is [private]. [private] the [private] and [private] of the GitHub repository located at:  
https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense/tree/main/surfsense_backend/app/agents/researcher

I am submitting this counter-notification under 17 U.S.C. § 512(g) to contest the DMCA takedown request submitted by Aeterno Platform LLC.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

The code in the referenced directory was independently developed by [private] and is **not a literal or substantial copy** of any proprietary source code. The project draws conceptual and architectural inspiration from existing open-source research agents such as:

- [private]  
- [private]

These public repositories provided foundational ideas, and [private] implementation was created with original logic and structure based on [private] [private] research and experimentation. I have not signed any agreement with Aeterno Platform LLC that grants them rights over this code, nor did I publish anything developed under such contractual obligation.

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (or, if outside the United States, the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

My full contact information is as follows:
