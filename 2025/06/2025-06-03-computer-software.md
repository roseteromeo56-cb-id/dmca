**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the original creator of the computer software for the game "[private]", which includes all source code, executable files, and related documentation. The software was independently developed by us and qualifies as an original work protected under copyright law. We retain exclusive ownership of all rights, including reproduction, distribution, and creation of derivative works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The game "[private]" is an unreleased game, which is currently in confidential testing and ongoing development. The infringing material on GitHub (specifically [private] files) constitutes a clear violation of our intellectual property rights. These files were obtained through unauthorized decryption and illegal circumvention of technical protection measures applied to our unreleased game "[private]".

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/yarik0chka/ZZZData

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The copyrighted software is protected by multiple technological measures:  
Code obfuscation: Critical components are obfuscated to prevent unauthorized analysis.  
Encryption: Proprietary algorithms and asset files are encrypted to restrict access.  
License validation: A digital rights management (DRM) system verifies user licenses via a secure server API before granting access.  
These measures effectively control access to the software and its functionality, ensuring only authorized users can utilize it as intended.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing GitHub repository distributes tools/methods that directly bypass my technological protections:  
Deobfuscation scripts: Reverse-engineers obfuscated code to expose and modify core game logic.  
Cracked license keys: Generates unauthorized licenses or patches the DRM validation process to grant illegal access.  
Decryption tools: Extracts encrypted assets for reuse in unauthorized derivatives.  
By distributing these circumvention tools, the project enables unauthorized access and modification of my copyrighted software.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
