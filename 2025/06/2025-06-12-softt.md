Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,  
  
I, [private], is submitting this notice on behalf of Softt, the sole and exclusive owner of the copyright in the software product ElegantOTA Pro. I am the [private] of Softt and duly authorized to act on its behalf in this matter.  
  
ElegantOTA Pro is a commercially licensed, proprietary OTA (Over-the-Air) update system for embedded devices. It is not open source and may not be copied, redistributed, or used to create derivative works without explicit written authorization from Softt.    
  
I have identified unauthorized and infringing content hosted on GitHub in a repository called PrettyOTA, which copies and modifies substantial portions of [private] original software. I am submitting this takedown request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. Â§ 512. I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
1. Identification of the Original Work  

Work: ElegantOTA Pro  
  
Official URL: https://elegantota.pro  
  
License: Softt Commercial License 1.2 (attached)  
  
Nature: Commercial proprietary software (frontend and backend) for embedded OTA updates  
  
ElegantOTA Pro includes a custom frontend with drag-and-drop UI, SVG animations, and a C++ backend using AsyncWebServer, session authentication, gzipped HTML serving, firmware rollback, and OTA progress tracking.  
  
ElegantOTA Pro is licensed under Softt Commercial License 1.2 and the license explicitly mentions that:  
Licensee shall not sublicense the Licensed Material to any third party.  
Licensee shall not use the Licensed Material to build, develop, or offer any product or service that directly or indirectly competes with the products or services offered by Licensor.  

2. Infringing Repository Details  

Repository URL: https://github.com/LostInCompilation/PrettyOTA  
  
GitHub Username: @LostInCompilation ([private])  
  
The repository above contains infringing content across its entire codebase, including:  
  
ðŸ”¹ Frontend Infringement  
prettyOTA.html (https://github.com/LostInCompilation/PrettyOTA/blob/main/website/login.html): Replicates [private] UI layout, class structure, visual animations, and branding style from ElegantOTA Pro.  
  
ðŸ”¹ Backend Infringement  
PrettyOTA.cpp/.h/.Callbacks.cpp (https://github.com/LostInCompilation/PrettyOTA/tree/main/src): Contains OTA handlers, gzipped page delivery, user session management, reboot logic, callback structure (onStart, onProgress, onEnd), and file upload routing that are substantially similar to [private] original work / source code of ElegantOTA Pro.  
  
This is also clearly evident from the demo GIF/video (https://github.com/LostInCompilation/PrettyOTA?tab=readme-ov-file#demo-) included in the README file of the PrettyOTA repository where we can see a lot of similarity between ElegantOTA Pro and PrettyOTA. (Our demo video is located at https://elegantota.pro)  
  
[private] has blatantly copied, modified, and distributed the proprietary source code of ElegantOTA Pro under the guise of an open-source project named "PrettyOTA".  
  
3. Infringing Forks  

The repository has also been forked at least 10 times. I have reviewed each of these forks and confirm that they all contain the same infringing content. Please disable them as well.

4. Remedy Requested
5. 
Due to the nature and extent of the infringement, the infringing party must:  
  
Delete the entire PrettyOTA repository and all of its forks  
  
Cease redistributing, modifying, or referencing any portion of ElegantOTA Pro or derivative work  
  
Refrain from building similar OTA systems based on stolen intellectual property  
  
Removal of PrettyOTA from any public registries including but not limited to PlatformIO registry and Arduino Library Registry  
  
No attribution or code-level modification can resolve this, as the project as a whole is a derivative and infringing work.  
  
5. Sworn Statements  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
  
I have read and understand GitHubâ€™s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
