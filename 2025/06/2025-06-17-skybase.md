To GitHub Support,  
I am [private], the [private] and [private] of Skybase Innovations, a registered software company based in [private].  
I am requesting a DMCA takedown for two repositories currently published under a former employeeâ€™s personal GitHub account ([private] / Samir007-rb). The links are:  
- https://github.com/Samir007-rb/b2b-website  
- https://github.com/Samir007-rb/Nikee-web  
These projects were originally developed under client contracts by Skybase Innovations and are actively maintained under our [private] organization:  
- [private]  
- [private]  
They were never open-sourced or authorized for redistribution. [private] was involved in these projects during his time with us as a developer, but the code, documentation, and delivery were commissioned and owned entirely by Skybase Innovations for commercial clients. The re-uploading of these projects to his personal GitHub account is unauthorized and constitutes a misrepresentation of ownership and a violation of our IP and client agreements.
