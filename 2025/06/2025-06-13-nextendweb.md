**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an employee of Nextendweb:  
https://nextendweb.com/  
Nextendweb is the developer and copyright holder of the "Nextend Social Login Pro Addon" WordPress plugin. Our company is the sole owner of the copyrights associated with the source code, design, and other intellectual property contained within the "Nextend Social Login Pro Addon." We retain all rights to the distribution and licensing of the plugin. As a member of the development team, I am authorized to act on behalf of Nextendweb in matters relating to copyright enforcement, including DMCA takedown requests.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the "Nextend Social Login Pro Addon," a premium WordPress plugin developed and distributed exclusively by Nextendweb. This plugin is an extension to our free "Nextend Social Login" plugin and provides advanced features such as login through additional social media providers, extended user management options, and integration capabilities designed for website owners and their clients.

This Pro Addon is distributed only to paying customers under a commercial license that strictly prohibits redistribution, resale, or inclusion in third-party themes, repositories, or public code hosting platforms. Full details of our licensing terms are available in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section of our official website: https://nextendweb.com/social-login/.

The unauthorized repository hosted at https://github.com/pronamic/nextend-social-login-pro includes the full source code of our commercial product, violating our copyright by making it publicly accessible without permission or license. This unauthorized distribution harms our business and infringes on our exclusive rights as the copyright holder, thus we would like it to be taken down.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The source code of the "Nextend Social Login Pro Addon" is not publicly available, as it is distributed exclusively to paying customers in accordance with our licensing terms.

However, to assist in validating our claim, I can provide a one-time coupon code that will allow you to obtain the "Standard" package of the Pro Addon free of charge via our official website:  
https://nextendweb.com/social-login/#pricing

This will enable you to verify and compare the original source code with the content hosted in the infringing repository.

Please let me know if you would like me to generate and provide this coupon code.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/pronamic/nextend-social-login-pro

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The Pro Addon can only be downloaded by the paying customers through a secure customer account area:  
https://secure.nextendweb.com/

In addition, the plugin requires a valid license key for activation and access to updates, which acts as a technological measure to control unauthorized use and distribution.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project makes the full source code of our commercial Pro Addon publicly available on GitHub, bypassing our protected customer-only distribution system. This circumvents our access control measures, which include distribution through secured user accounts.

By making the plugin publicly accessible without authorization, the repository effectively removes the need for users to purchase a package in order to get the installer.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
