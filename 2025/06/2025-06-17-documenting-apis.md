Yes, I am the copyright holder.

No  
  
**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
[private] own the API documentation course content (titled "Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers") at https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc, served from [private] repo https://github.com/tomjoht/tomjoht.github.io through GitHub Pages. [private] wrote the content [private], and there aren't any open licenses allowing re-use.  
  
Note that [private] originally had this course content in a separate repo at https://github.com/tomjoht/learnapidoc. This is the repo that the user cloned and unlawfully republished as his own. [private] since deactivated that learnapidoc repo and migrated the content into [private] main repo at https://github.com/tomjoht/tomjoht.github.io (to merge the course content with [private] blog in one repo).  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The user [private], with an account at https://github.com/aiegoo, has unlawfully taken [private] API documentation course content from https://idratherbewriting.com and published it as his own here: https://aiegoo.github.io/apidoc. Here is his cloned repo: https://github.com/aiegoo/documentation2. This isn't just an inadvertent clone. The user fully configured GitHub Pages to serve up this content as his own and draw traffic to his site. Here are some more details:  
  
* The user lightly altered (changing the first paragraph) [private] About me page to his own name and photo, https://aiegoo.github.io/apidoc/docapis_about_the_author.html. But everything else is [private] story.  
* The user changed the course name from "Documenting APIs" to "Learning Curves."  
* The user customized the Buy me a Coffee button and pointed users to supporting his "Learning Curves" site: [private]  
* The user customized the newsletter signup form to his own service with tinyletter.  
  
Despite these small changes, the course content is 99% unchanged and is wholesale theft of [private] content, presumably redistributed on GitHub Pages to draw traffic away from [private] site at https://idratherbewriting.com to his own site at https://aiegoo.github.io/apidoc.  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
To remedy the infringement, the user should disable his GitHub Pages integration for [private] API documentation content. Specifically, GitHub Pages should be disabled for https://github.com/aiegoo/documentation2.
