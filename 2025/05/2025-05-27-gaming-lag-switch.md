**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Dear GitHub Copyright Team,  
I am writing to submit a formal DMCA takedown notice regarding the unauthorized use of my copyrighted work in the following repository:

Infringing Repository:  
https://github.com/Sinnisterly/lagger

Original Work (Copyrighted Material):  
[private]: [private]  
License: MIT ([private])

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the work "Gaming-Lag-Switch," released under the MIT License. My repository clearly states the copyright notice and licensing terms, which require attribution and inclusion of the license in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original project is a software utility designed to simulate network latency ("lag switch") for gaming purposes. The repository includes source code files, documentation, and a clear MIT License granting specific permissions under the condition that the copyright notice and license terms are preserved in all derivatives.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/Sinnisterly/lagger

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing repository (Sinnisterly/lagger) has copied substantial portions of [private] work without complying with the MIT License requirements. Specifically:  
- The repository fails to include the original copyright notice in all files.  
- It does not provide proper attribution to the original author (me) or link to the MIT License.

This omission constitutes a violation of Section 1(a) of the MIT License, which states:  
"The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software."

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

I request that GitHub:  
- Disables or removes the infringing repository (Sinnisterly/lagger) for violating the license terms.  
- Notifies the user of the violation and directs them to comply with the MIT License by providing proper attribution or ceasing use of the material.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
